         <b>Deltaretroviruses</b>
         (<a target="_blank" href ="https://viralzone.expasy.org/91">genus <i>Deltaretrovirus</i></a>)
         are a highly unusual genus of retroviruses
         (<a target="_blank" href ="https://viralzone.expasy.org/71">family <i>Retroviridae</i></a>)
         that have only been identified in a restricted subset of mammalian species.
         They include the primate T-cell lymphotropic viruses (<b>PTLVs</b>) that infect apes
         (including humans) and Old World monkeys, and bovine leukemia virus (<b>BLV</b>) which
         infects cattle.
 	   </p>


	   
	   <p>
         Like all retroviruses, deltaretroviruses cause common, persistent infections.
         Infection is frequently asymptomatic, but can lead to
         inflammatory and malignant disease over the longer term.

	    <b>Deltaretroviruses and their hosts</b>. Left to right: (i) mandrills
		(ii) colobus monkeys and (iii) chimpanzees are among the many species of African
		primate infected with deltaretroviruses. Human populations are also infected,
		and have been for millennia - deltaretroviral proviruses have been recovered from
		mummified remains in the Andes (iv), showing that deltaretroviruses were present 
		in human populations that reached South America.

		   This is <b>Deltaretrovirus-GLUE</b>, a GLUE
		   project supporting comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis of
		   <a target="_blank" href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/91">deltaretroviruses</a>.
		   It contains a richly annotated sequence dataset for these viruses, comprised of both 
		   <a href="./website/html/viruses.html"><b>viral sequences</b></a>
		   and
		   <a href="./website/html/paleoviruses.html"><b>endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)</b></a>.
		  
		 </p>

		 <p>
		
				
		   <b>There are a wide variety of ways in which the Deltaretrovirus-GLUE resource can be used</b>:
		   
		   <ul>
		 
			 <li> To perform comparative genomic studies across the family <i>Deltaretrovirus</i>,
			 e.g. as part of an investigation of deltaretrovirus diversity.
			 </li>
		   
			 <br>
		 
			 <li> To facilitate in-depth comparative investigations of any virus species or group
			 within the family <i>Deltaretrovirus</i>.
			 </li>
		    
			 <br>
	   
			 <li> As a source of systematically organised information about
			 <a href="./website/html/paleoviruses.html"><b>endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) derived from deltaretroviruses</b></a>.
			 </li>
		   
		   </ul>
